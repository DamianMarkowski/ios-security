# iOS Security
A collaborative list of learning materials about a security in the iOS apps

Welcome to iOS Security repository ðŸ‘‹

The main goal of this repo is to help people learn how to make their iOS apps more secure. Security is not a topic that all iOS developers touch on a daily basis. To some of us it seems quite hard to start learning about it so I thought it would be great to create a collaborative space with all the useful links to the articles, videos, podcasts, Twitter profiles of people working in a security area and other useful resources ðŸ™ƒ

Please feel free to submit your Pull Requests, suggest new links that you find useful and helpful.
