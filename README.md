## Welcome to iOS Security repository üëã

The main goal of this repo is to help people learn how to make their iOS apps more secure. Security is not a topic that all iOS developers touch on a daily basis. To some of us it seems quite hard to start learning about it so I thought it would be great to create a collaborative space with all the useful links to the articles, videos, podcasts, books and other useful resources üôÉ

Please feel free to submit your Pull Requests, suggest new links that you find useful and helpful.
