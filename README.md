A collaborative list of learning materials about a security in the iOS apps

## Welcome to iOS Security repository üëã

The main goal of this repo is to help people learn how to make their iOS apps more secure. Security is not a topic that all iOS developers touch on a daily basis. To some of us it seems quite hard to start learning about it so I thought it would be great to create a collaborative space with all the useful links to the articles, videos, books and other useful resources üôÉ 

As we all know, IT world is changing rapidly and information gets outdated quite quickly so next to the each resource you will find a date when it was published. You can decide on your own if that information is recent enough. Materials are sorted in each category, starting from the most recent ones.

Please feel free to submit your Pull Requests, suggest new links that you find useful and helpful.
